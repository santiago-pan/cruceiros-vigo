# Vigo Cruises
Android app showing Vigo city cruises.

Iâ€™ve always liked big cruisers since I was a kid, especially from the engineering point of view, as a clear example of how far the technical capacity of the human being. 
In the city of Vigo we have the opportunity to see great cruises often dock at our port with lots of tourists, but many times I have lost them because I have forgotten or arrive when they were gone. 
So to not happen it again I decided to make this simple application that displays information on the cruises that frequent our city to have it more accessible. 
At the moment is a little green but I promise to add some more features soon.
